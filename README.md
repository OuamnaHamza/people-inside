# PEOPLE INSIDE
PEOPLE INSIDE is **a real-time people counting system using ultrasonic sensors**.

#### Quick Start <<
```
git clone https://github.com/PEOPLE-INSIDE/people-inside
```

# Getting Started
### Why do we made *PEOPLE INSIDE*?
At meal time, there are too many people in a restaurant. So we have to wait in the restaurant. We want to check the number of indoor people in advance.

### Installation Environment

### Basic Principle
If the A sensor detects a person first, it means *IN*. And the reverse, it means *OUT*.
You can check the number of people with application.

### Why did you use ultrasonic sensors?
It is inexpensive so we can make system with low cost.
It is not affected by various environmental factors.
