# Algorithm of IN-N-OUT System

### What is an IN-N-OUT System?
- IN-N-OUT System is **a real-time people counting system using ultrasonic sensors**.

### Why did you made this?
- At meal time, there are too many people in the restaurant. So we have to wait in a restaurant. We want to check the number of indoor people in advance.

### Why did you use ultrasonic sensors?
- It is inexpensive so we can make system with low cost.
- It is not affected by various environmental factors.

### Basic Principle& System Architecture
- If the A sensor detects a person first, it means IN. And the reverse, it means OUT.
- You can check the number of people with application.
